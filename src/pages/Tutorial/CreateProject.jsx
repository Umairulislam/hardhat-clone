      <h1 className="tertiary-heading">3. Creating a new Hardhat project</h1>
      <p>
        We'll install Hardhat using the Node.js package manager (npm), which is
        both a package manager and an online repository for JavaScript code.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use other package managers with Node.js, but we suggest you use
        npm 7 or higher to follow this guide. You should already have it if you
        followed the previous section's steps.
      </p>
      <p>Open a new terminal and run these commands to create a new folder:</p>
      <CodeSnippet
        code={snippet1}
        language="javascript"
        showLineNumbers={true}
        isCopyable={true}
      />
      <p>
        Then initialize an npm project as shown below. You'll be prompted to
        answer some questions.
      </p>
      <div
        className={` border-l-8 border-[#42B983] w-full p-8 ${
          isDarkMode ? "bg-gray-200" : "bg-secondary"
        }`}
      >
        <h1>TIP</h1>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Use the tabs in the snippets to select your preferred package manager.
          We recommend using npm 7 or later, since it makes installing Hardhat's
          dependencies much easier.
        </p>
      </div>
      <CodeSnippet
        code={snippet2}
        language="javascript"
        showLineNumbers={true}
        isCopyable={true}
      />
      <p>Now we can install Hardhat:</p>
      <CodeSnippet
        code={snippet3}
        language="javascript"
        showLineNumbers={true}
        isCopyable={true}
      />
      <p>In the same directory where you installed Hardhat run:</p>
      <CodeSnippet
        code={snippet4}
        language="javascript"
        showLineNumbers={true}
        isCopyable={true}
      />
      <p>
        Select Create an empty hardhat.config.js with your keyboard and hit
        enter.
      </p>
      <CodeSnippet
        code={snippet5}
        language=""
        showLineNumbers={true}
        isCopyable={true}
      />
      <p>
        When Hardhat is run, it searches for the closest hardhat.config.js file
        starting from the current working directory. This file normally lives in
        the root of your project and an empty hardhat.config.js is enough for
        Hardhat to work. The entirety of your setup is contained in this file.
      </p>

        Hardhat's architecture
      </h2>
      <p>
        Hardhat is designed around the concepts of tasks and plugins. The bulk
        of Hardhat's functionality comes from plugins, and{" "}
        <span className="text-tertiary">you're free to choose</span>
        the ones you want to use.
      </p>
      <h2 className="plugin-heading">Tasks</h2>
      <p>
        Every time you're running Hardhat from the command-line, you're running
        a task. For example, npx hardhat compile is running the compile task. To
        see the currently available tasks in your project, run npx hardhat. Feel
        free to explore any task by running npx hardhat help [task].
      </p>
      <div
        className={` border-l-8 border-[#42B983] w-full p-8 ${
          isDarkMode ? "bg-gray-200" : "bg-secondary"
        }`}
      >
        <h1>TIP</h1>
        <p className="mt-2">
          You can create your own tasks. Check out the{" "}
          <span className="text-tertiary">Creating a task guide</span>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2 className="plugin-heading">Plugins</h2>
      <p>
        Hardhat is unopinionated in terms of what tools you end up using, but it
        does come with some built-in defaults. All of which can be overridden.
        Most of the time the way to use a given tool is by consuming a plugin
        that integrates it into Hardhat.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this tutorial we are going to use our recommended plugin,{" "}
        <span className="text-tertiary">@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox</span>{" "}
        , which has everything you need for developing smart contracts.
      </p>
      <p>To install it, run this in your project directory:</p>
      <CodeSnippet
        code={snippet6}
        language="javascript"
        showLineNumbers={true}
        isCopyable={true}
      />
      <p>
        Add the highlighted line to your hardhat.config.js so that it looks like
        this:
      </p>
      <CodeSnippet
        code={snippet7}
        language="javascript"
        showLineNumbers={true}
        isCopyable={true}
      />
    </section>

}
